//! The client-to-server packet vocabulary, per engine build.
//!
//! A TCP read is not a packet: a server frames the stream before the game ever sees it. The real
//! D2Net did that in `SERVER_ValidateClientPacket` @0x6FC01FE0 via `SERVER_GetClientPacketSize`
//! @0x6FC01E60, which indexes a table by the leading opcode. `cs.zig` carries 1.14d's; this file
//! carries every OTHER build's, read out of that build's own D2Net rather than transcribed from a
//! neighbour.
//!
//! Both halves of the conversation need this. A server has to frame what arrives, and a client has
//! to know which opcode its join even IS — those differ by build, and getting it wrong does not
//! produce an error: the engine dispatches the packet as whatever that number means to it and
//! answers something unrelated, or nothing at all.

// else it will send during a session — every opcode 0x00-0x63 — is byte-identical between the two,
// measured against 1.14d's own table: 102 of 112 entries match, and all ten differences sit in
// 0x64-0x6F, the session block Blizzard renumbered.
//
// The two joins are the same fields with one insertion:
//
//     1.14d  0x68, 37 bytes:  op | u32 hash | u16 token | u8 | u32 | u64 extra | u8 class | name[16]
//     1.10f  0x67, 29 bytes:  op | u32 hash | u16 gameId| u8 | u32 |             u8 class | name[16]
//

// exactly, which matters because d2ingress rewrites the token at byte 5 into the engine's game id
